# OneCore

A unified care-management system.

Mocha: will be used for running our tests.
Chai: will be used as our expectation library. Very versatile and lets us use RSpec like syntax.
Sinon: will be used for mocks/stubs/spys.
Enzyme: will be used for testing our React components. It's a beautiful testing library written by AirBnB.
